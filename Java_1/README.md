## Homework 1 - Week 1

### Motivation
* Demonstrate your ability to learn __git__ and use the __java__ and __javac__ commands

### Instructions
* There are two tasks to complete.
    - The first demonstrates basic knowledge of __git__.  Complete the introductory [git course](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1).  You must create a free [code school](https://www.codeschool.com) account and post a link to the earned badge from completing the course (the second step of the git course will link to assist in creating an account.  Additionally you will want to make your code school report public).  Once completed (i.e. you've earned the badge) create a file named `git.completed` and paste a link to your `Code School` account; for reference mine is [here](https://www.codeschool.com/users/4574608).  Again ensure your report card is public so it can be verified that you've completed the course.
    - Demonstrate your ability to use __java__ and __javac__ commands.  Run `./homework.sh` and first generate the questions.  Then answer the questions and test your answers.
